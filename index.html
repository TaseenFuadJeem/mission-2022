            <p>Staying focused is one of the hardest tasks when pursuing a new hobby, goal or project. Trying to break a
                bad
                habit? I'm sure you've been there. Trying to get healthy, maybe shed a few pounds, or even add some?
                That
                requires 100% focus. A momentary lapse can spell trouble for a solid weeks worth of good choices. How
                about
                I
                throw Web Development into the mix? One of the fastest moving and dynamic fields in Tech. Hopefully,
                with these few tips, I can help you either stay on track, or prevent you from listening to that doubtful
                little voice in the back of your head telling you to quit. Everyone has experienced these hurdles.
                You're not alone, so let's get into it.

                <p>What I try to tell young people is that if you come together with a mission, and its grounded with
                    love and a sense of community, you can make the impossible possible.

                <p>
                    Keep your dreams alive. Understand to achieve anything requires faith and belief in yourself,
                    vision,
                    hard work, determination, and dedication. Remember all things are possible for those who believe.

                <p>
                    Everyone has a purpose in life and a unique talent to give to others. And when we blend this unique
                    talent with service to others, we experience the ecstasy and exultation of own spirit, which is the
                    ultimate goal of all goals.

                No web development learning is complete without a hands-on project. In this platform, we’ll be using the
                three pillars of the web (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) to build your first project, a personalized
                portfolio website. Once you have these under your belt, picking up other tools and languages is much
                easier. Pay extra attention to the basics, as a shaky foundation leads to loads of confusion later on.
                We’ll also give you the resources needed to put your website online so that you can share it with your
                friends and family and last but not least you have to work hard limitless.

            <p>
                If you want to grow as a developer, I can't over-emphasize the benefits of joining a developer
                community. There are many advantages, from peer-programming to sharing knowledge, mentorship, sharing
                support, sharing tools, code reviews, answering questions, and much more.Communities are usually built
                on shared struggles of individuals learning in a particular region, and the goals of each community
                differ per the individual's collective needs.
