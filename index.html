            <p>Staying focused is one of the hardest tasks when pursuing a new hobby, goal or project. Trying to break a
                bad
                habit? I'm sure you've been there. Trying to get healthy, maybe shed a few pounds, or even add some?
                That
                requires 100% focus. A momentary lapse can spell trouble for a solid weeks worth of good choices. How
                about
                I
                throw Web Development into the mix? One of the fastest moving and dynamic fields in Tech.

                <p>What I try to tell young people is that if you come together with a mission, and its grounded with
                    love and a sense of community, you can make the impossible possible.

                <p>
                    Keep your dreams alive. Understand to achieve anything requires faith and belief in yourself,
                    vision,
                    hard work, determination, and dedication. Remember all things are possible for those who believe.

                <p>
                    Everyone has a purpose in life and a unique talent to give to others. And when we blend this unique
                    talent with service to others, we experience the ecstasy and exultation of own spirit, which is the
                    ultimate goal of all goals.

                No web development course is complete without a hands-on project. In this course, we’ll be using the
                three pillars of the web (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) to build your first project, a personalized
                portfolio website. Once you have these under your belt, picking up other tools and languages is much
                easier. Pay extra attention to the basics, as a shaky foundation leads to loads of confusion later on.
                We’ll also give you the resources needed to put your website online so that you can share it with your
                friends and family.

            <h1>Global Community</h1>
            <p>
                Globalization refers to the rising global connections and interdependence that characterize modern life.
                Globalization is centered at the heart of culture and culture is at the heart of globalization. This
                means that the enormous changes of our time remain difficult to understand until they are grasped
                through the term ‘culture’. Culture harbors much weight in globalization because it is an intrinsic
                factor of sophisticated connectivity. Therefore, culture orientates people individually and as a whole
                towards particular actions which culminate to globalization.

                    Avoid crowds and close contact. Wear a properly fitted mask when physical distancing is not possible
                    and in poorly ventilated settings. Clean your hands frequently with alcohol-based hand rub or soap
                    and water. Cover your mouth and nose with a bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze.
